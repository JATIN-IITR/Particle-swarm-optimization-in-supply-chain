The COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted supply chains, presenting new challenges for maintaining service levels. In response, we have developed a mathematical model aimed at managing supply chains in the post-pandemic era, often referred to as the "new normal." Our goal is to design and simulate various scenarios to optimize the network, ensuring it meets customer demand effectively. The model is demonstrated through a case study involving a packaged drinking water supply chain, with a focus on minimizing operating costs in light of capacity changes due to the pandemic. Additionally, we have recorded the fill-rate as a key performance metric. We utilized Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to achieve this optimization. This research provides valuable insights for supply chain practitioners and researchers, aiding in network design and risk management for future pandemics or similar disruptions.
